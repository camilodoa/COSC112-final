Our final project for Amherst College's S2019 COSC-112 course.

This program takes in the user's picture/profile and edits it in a number of selectable ways.
It uses a facial recognition back end in Python to help automate some distortions.

profile -> *weird* profile

## Installation:
 * Make sure you have Python 3.65

  * *Make sure the python3 command calls the Python 3.65 interpreter*

 * Install OpenCV

 ```pip3 install opencv-python```

 * Install Python's Pillow library

 ```python3 -m pip install Pillow```

 * Install main and contrib OpenCV modules

 ```pip3 install opencv-contrib-python```



## To Run:
  * `javac *.java && java Main`
  * *there are test images you can try out in the `images` folder!*
  * Please be patient if you want to try other distortions after saving an image! The program takes a little time to get back on track.
